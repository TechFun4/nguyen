# Mr. Nguyen's Website

Hello students, parents, and teachers! I am TechFun, and I welcome you to the source code of Mr. Nguyen's Website! Free free to dig into the files! The website is currently hosted on [https://mrnguyen.cf](https://mrnguyen.cf).

## How It Works

The "static" and "templates" folder should be in the same directory as the "main.py" file. This project uses Python-Flask to serve the web files and HTML, CSS, and JS to render the web pages. Inside the templates folder, there is a "header.html" which is served with every html file, containing the navigation bar and the footer (and also the "head" which is not displayed on the website). The "header.html" imports the "main.js" and "main.css" which make the website look the way it does. Along with this, the web pages use Bootstrap CSS. The "static" folder contains images such as the logo and the favicon (the tiny image in the tab).
